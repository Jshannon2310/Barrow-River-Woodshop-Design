### Features Left to Implement

- I would like to add a hamburger menu to the site when the site is used in smaller screens.

## Testing

- I have done lots of testing on all the links in the site. All the linkis on the top Nav bar work correctly and navigate the user to the correct page. The links in the footer also work as intended with the instagram link navigating to the Barrow River Woodshop Design instagram page and the oter links navigating to the login page of said social meadia site. There is 2 other links used in the web site, ons on the home which navigates to a youtube vide for STONEYCNC and one on the bottom of the contact page which is linked to the contact page. Both work as intended. 

- Testing on the responsive of the site dident go to plan. The origional product page I had designed did not work well in smaller screens. Many hour was spent trying to fix this but in the end I decided to redesign the page and I used a gallery style layout I found on [W3SCHOOLS](https://www.w3schools.com/css/css_image_gallery.asp) which I feel looks better.

- Another problem I came across once I had designed the new gallery was that when I resized the screen the footer was coming up the right hand side of the screen. But with the help of Google and [Freecode Camp](https://www.freecodecamp.org/news/how-to-keep-your-footer-where-it-belongs-59c6aa05c59c/) I wqas able to fix this issue.
